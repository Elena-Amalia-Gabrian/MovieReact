# Movie Search Website

This is movie search website built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, and the OMDB API. This website allows users to enter the name of a movie and retrieve movies that match the search criteria.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for searching movies by title.
- Retrieves movies from the OMDB API based on the search query.
- Displays movie information such as title, year, plot, and poster image.
- Supports searching for movies with titles containing specific words.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS3: Stylesheet language for enhancing the visual appearance.
- JavaScript: Programming language for interactive functionality.
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- OMDB API: External API for retrieving movie data.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Elena-Amalia-Gabrian/MovieReact.git

2. Install dependencies using npm:
   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   npm start

4. Open the website in your browser

# Usage

Enter the name of a movie in the search bar.
Click the magnifying glass icon to initiate the search.
The website will display the movies that contain the words introduced in the search bar or "No movies found" if there are no movies with that title.
Scroll through the results to find the desired movie information.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
